# Call-Center-Data-Analytics-Visualization-with-Power-BI
## Project Overview
This Power BI project showcases my ability to leverage data visualization, automation, and data cleansing techniques to solve real-world business challenges. I created interactive dashboards focusing on Call Center Trends, Customer Retention, and Diversity & Inclusion. These dashboards equip PwC Switzerland and their clients with actionable insights to improve operational efficiency, strengthen customer loyalty, and foster a more inclusive workplace.

## Task 1
Create a dashboard in Power BI for visualizing relevant KPIs and metrics in the dataset provided.</br>
Utilize the resources provided, including podcasts and articles, to enhance your understanding of data visualization and upskilling.</br>
Respond to the client's request by providing a well-designed Power BI dashboard reflecting the requested KPIs.</br>

Possible KPIs include:</br>
Overall customer satisfaction</br>
Overall calls answered/abandoned</br>
Calls by time</br>
Average speed of answer</br>
Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered</br>

## Task 2 Customer Retention
Create a dashboard using the defined KPIs to reflect customer demographics and insights.</br>
Write a concise email to the engagement partner explaining your findings and providing suggestions for necessary changes based on the dashboard you've created.</br>
In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:</br>
Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them.</br>
The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination.</br> 
Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk.</br>
We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end.</br>
We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management.</br>

## Task 3 Diversity & Inclusion
Create visualizations to represent HR data, particularly focusing on gender-related KPIs.</br>
Identify and discuss potential root causes for the slow progress in achieving gender balance at the executive management level.</br>
Define relevant KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance and turnover, and create a visualisation.</br>
Write what you think some root causes of their slow progress might be.</br>
